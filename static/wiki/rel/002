~~ ../about ~~

selfcomp label (or directory, or collections...)
holds a collection of self-compilations,
i.e. collections of pieces made by the authors themselves


~~~ about selfcomp ~~~

see ../rel/001 and ../index

and ../screencast if you want a video explanation


~~~ about release ../rel/002 ~~~

aka. the 'minimalist release',
../rel/002 has multimedia selfcomps:
images, software hacks, philosophical asserts
joined in.
Antunes and Glerm sent a second selfcomp,
and Barros joined the music selfcompers.

best track IMHO might be Microformobiles III (Antunes)
with Gurevich and Schvartz's performance,
but the 1 minute 'The New Riddle Of Induction' (Glerm)
is not easely overstated.


~~~ state of selfcomp ~~~

as of Seg Jun 4 2018,
multimedia selfcomps are being published,
multilevel estrategies (e.g. marketing)
are being thought about by many partners,
at least some more releases are goind to happen,
given the nice materials sent by selfcompers
(see ../index).
