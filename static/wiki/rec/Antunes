~ Jorge Antunes ~

~~ tracks :second: self-compilation ../rel/002 ~~

1) IDIOSYNCHRONIE, 1972, ~ 27 min
Lodz Plhilarmonic Orchestra, Jorge Antunes (conductor)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5m2thE4MBQ&feature=youtu.be
    2m music starts.
    wow sonorities achieved (also probably) by mixing and matering
    the scenes and illumination of the video add to the sonic discourse
    muringa, insects, wistles in a very pleasant piece
    ~ 10m, something changes with a low pitched intervention
    development

2) Microformobiles III (re-tornos), 1982, > 11 min
violin (Elias Gurevich) and piano (Haydée Schvartz)
  https://youtu.be/qJoDcg8xFqg
    calm start, few notes discourse.
    2m, timbre variation, 
    delicious performance and sonorities
    impressive
    4m, pause and a new movement/subpiece starts
    6m, another one, yeah jow
    8m13s, another one.
    9m57s, the last one
    best piece of this :second: selfcomp IMHO


~~ tracks of :first: self-compilation ../rel/001 ~~

1- Interlude nº 1 pour Olga
(eletroacústica)
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be7lWO-tS9Y
    as in trap and dubstep, this piece only catches me after the first 1m.
    electronic, eletro-cello electro-organ sounds.

2- DANÇA DA MULHER VERMELHA
(eletroacústica)
Balé eletrônico de
A CARTOMANTE
Ópera em 3 atos de Jorge Antunes
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0GGqGndlk
    this piece is without orchesta.
    I miss the lirics, i cannot understand all of it
    Beautiful maternal pulse around 8m

3-MIXOLYDIA
(Lydia Kavina, theremin)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2u4767Ertk
    ow this piece is a delight.
    around 2m30s it catched me.
    listen carefully for this marvelous piece and performance.
    4m, r++
    the piece gets even better as it goes on to 8m-10m.
    and then more appealing, a pity he does not explore the rythms more. r++

4- Maracatuzinho da Mariuga: 
  https://youtu.be/7yIs16eLBkU
    piano piece, maracatu-inspired with freaky electronics
    Helena Elias (piano)
    cute piece, I want more

5- Frevinho da Sônia
piano: Alexandre Dias
  https://youtu.be/KdX4V_1E2Y
    and here is more as well.
    very nice pure instrumental music
    music of dots ("música de bolinha")
    I got curious about the techniques used, how would Antunes describe it

6- Modinha do Amaral
piano: Alexandre Dias
  https://youtu.be/YNmg_YaomUI
    another pure piano music (no electronics, not prepared).
    the video could have the sheet roll with the music, a pity .
    the techniques, how would he describe

7- ELEGIA VIOLETA PARA MONSENHOR ROMERO (Final)
  https://youtu.be/u6MkKNhFYts
    this is a fantastic musical piece.
    the video is also worth the time.
