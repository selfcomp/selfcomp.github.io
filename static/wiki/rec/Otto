~~ about Otto ~~

stage musician, uses sensors, laptop, cello

a master of using kinky and delicate voices,
as in Six (from his new album, to be released
in the last weeks of May/2018), or in
Bangalore wispers:
  https://soundcloud.com/andiotto/bangalorewhispers

fluent with sensors, one man band presentations, 
academic, model and mythological hacker.
Just hear the sounds, if it was not, it would not be.

his music, IMHO, incorporates very much of human musical
idioms: voices, trap (yes, trap music),
advanced instruments (cello, computer and other hardware),
mythology (seems so, to be confirmed),
elaborated rhythms and dancy stuff,
performance (with cello, computer and cello)
melody and harmony sometimes has lass emphasis
(as considered merit by contemporary classical music circuits),

his new record has other hits as:
  manu roto
  the taste of bambu

  
~~~ questions ~~~

what is your relation to mythology?

do you write? draw? make videos?

who is MD Pallavi?

Why Six (not five or three)?
Why Bangalore?

what are the benefits and drawbacks,
for you and other people,
of using closed approaches to distribution
of your work?
(if any, such as with programmed releases of material,
and files that should not be shared.)
