1) attrito
   amplified ensemble and electronic sounds
   text by Giuseppe Ungaretti
   performed by ICE (International Contemporary Ensemble)
    https://soundcloud.com/bernardobarros/attrito
      baboo music with cats or nail stuff
      flute.
      big elephant-cat around 2m30s.
      aurora borealis ~ 3m, then elastic gestures.
      singing voice ~ 4m20s
      electronics ~ 5m
      pimball 5m50s, then shakes and stops
      elastic rhythms, nice
      develops further on, cool piece, groovy sonorities

2) spill
    https://soundcloud.com/bernardobarros/spill
      a discourse made of a wide range of sonorities
      1m30s changes for only one sound or few
      2m20 rhythmic/percussive overlay, it then stands alone
      3m again one sound then piano overlay
      beautiful ondines
      development

3) catastrophe
    https://soundcloud.com/bernardobarros/catastrophe-2012-gnarwhallaby
      clarinet-sinusoid gang, tentacles
      + night/marsh fire
      beautiful piece
      ~ 2m50, angular stuff comes to be all the sudden
      point point sound blink twinkle little star

4) BROKEN
    https://soundcloud.com/bernardobarros/broken
      begins breaking good
      nice ticles and silences

5) map of broken clear glass
    https://soundcloud.com/bernardobarros/map-of-broken-clear-glass
      best piece of the album IMHO
      vintage visceral victory vastly vanderful
      half-ball, half-insect beings of light and rubber
      tribal and electronic technology
