~~ tracks of the :first: self-compilation ~~

sent his selfcomp as files (upload to cloud by ../rf):
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample
    I found no specific order among the pieces.
    If this is an unpublished work, it might not be
    in accordance with the self-compilation proposal,
    but is a decent enough album to be an exception.

1) 02-after branco
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/02-after_branco.ogg
    a very interesting improvisation-like, calm, instrumental, beautiful melody
    blend of background nostalgic vinyl noise with traditional and popular instruments
2) canela
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/canela.ogg
    cuíca, voices, keyboard, bass, guitar, moderate singing
3) dragon
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/dragon.mp3
    is a binary freak show with a guitar
    synth-like sound and synths
4) pancadao do bem
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/pancadao-do_bem.mp3
    a quasi-xuxa carioca funk with
    lá-lá-lá, tells the story of a harridan who brews coffee
    on the underwear and uses black and red
    ~~~ i am going to remix you ~~~ ("eu vô te sampleá")
5) RemixOn
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/remixon.mp3
    is funny and "saracutiante", cheerful.
    It holds a non-important but entertaining narrative,
    wile mixing popular instruments, rhythms, and declamation.
    should be the first piece in this collection because
    it opens a presentation, as in a rodeo.
6) rio samba show
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/rio_samba_show.mp3
    quasi-samba.
    show yes. Carnival?
    frevo-flavour saracutiaçaum
    ah, no cuíca here? 1m
    ow yeah, 1m25s
    saracuteia irmaum
7) wilsoriginal
  https://archive.org/details/originaisDoSample/wilsoriginal.mp3
    electro-samba-rock
    mushy thick-thuck-thack-théck, nice


~~~ beyond self-compilation ~~~

A) more stuff, DJ sets it seems.
Need to ask more about it


~~ about Machado ~~

DJ, software developer, social entrepreneur, makes parties and people dance,
free software outcast wannabe


~~~ questions ~~~

do you have higher quality files of these pieces for us to remix?

do you write? draw?

should I reorder the pieces to make a different
sequence? E.g. RemixOn might be the first
(for me it is quite fine as is)
