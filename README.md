# selfcomp.github.io
blog of the selfcomp label or directory for self compilations: overall-lifelong collections of musical / sonic pieces selected by the authors themselves.


## versions
until
SÃ¡b Jun  2 23:49:06 -03 2018,
selfcomp was Vim generated with :TOhtml
and prv:
  https://github.com/ttm/prv

From then on, for ./rel/002, 
a tentative Flask implementation
is being used.


### starting Flask selfcomp
install Flask with pip

export the mode (auto-reload and debug) and app:
  $ export FLASK_APP=selfcomp.py

if you are hacking selfcomp:
  $ export FLASK_ENV=development

and start the server with
  $ flask run
